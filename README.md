# MQTT-Adapter
Connecting MQTT services with the Messaging System.
This component subscribes to topics from the Internet of Things
protocol MQTT and forwards them to the messaging system which uses
Apache Kafka.
Therefore both services must be running:
* [MQTT-broker](https://github.com/iot-salzburg/mqtt-adapter)
* [messaging-system](https://github.com/iot-salzburg/messaging-system)


The MQTT Adapter is based on the components:
* Paho-MQTT Messaging Client, [paho.mqtt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.3.1) version **1.3.1**
* Kafka Client [librdkafka](https://github.com/geeknam/docker-confluent-python) version **0.11.1**
* Python Kafka module [confluent-kafka-python](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python) version **0.9.1.2**

## Requirements

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) version **1.10.0+**
2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version **1.6.0+**
3. Clone this repository


## Deployment

The IOT-Adapter uses the optionally Sensorthings to semantically describe
the forwarded data. The later consumage of the sensor data with the
suggested [DB-Adapter](https://github.com/i-maintenance/DB-Adapter/)
works best with a running and feeded [SensorThings](https://github.com/i-maintenance/SensorThingsClient)
 Client.



### Testing
Using `docker-compose`:

```bash
cd /iot-adapter
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```Trouble-shooting

The flag `-d` stands for running it in background (detached mode):


Watch the logs with:

```bash
sudo docker-compose logs -f
```


### Deployment in a docker swarm
Using `docker stack`:

If not already done, add a regitry instance to register the image
```bash
cd /iot-Adapter
sudo docker service create --name registry --publish published=5001,target=5000 registry:2
curl 127.0.0.1:5001/v2/
```
This should output `{}`:


If running with docker-coTrouble-shootingmpose works, push the image in order to make the customized image runnable in the stack

```bash
cd ../iot-Adapter
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose push
```

Actually deploy the service in the stack:
```bash
cd ../IOT-Adapter
sudo docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml iot-adapter
```


Watch if everything worked fine with:

```bash
sudo docker service ls
sudo docker stack ps iot-adapter
sudo docker service logs iot-adapter_adapter -f
```


## Configuration

The IOT-Adapter uses a Whitelist (`datastreams.json`) as well as a
Blacklist (`blacklist.json`). The first one lists any data which should be
forwarded into the i-Maintenance Messaging System with its corresponding
SensorThings - Datastream-Id. The later lists sensordata that should be
ignored by the IOT-Adapter. If data is fetched without being in any of
these files, a warning message is produced that will be seen if running:

```bash
sudo docker service logs iot-adapter_adapter -f
```


## Trouble-shooting

#### Can't apt-get update in Dockerfile:
Restart the service

```sudo service docker restart```

or add the file `/etc/docker/daemon.json` with the content:
```
{
    "dns": [your_dns, "8.8.8.8"]
}
```
where `your_dns` can be found with the command:

```bash
nmcli device show <interfacename> | grep IP4.DNS
```

####  Traceback of non zero code 4 or 128:

Restart service with
```sudo service docker restart```

or add your dns address as described above
